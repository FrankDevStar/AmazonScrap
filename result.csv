Did you mean 30 feet total or adding 30 more feet to the 20 feet the ice kit comes with?

iSpring,B008H71Q4C,ICEK,How long will a plastic tube like this last before needing to be replaced? Is it better to get stainless steel?,The plastic tubing appears to be very durable. I would not try to use anything else unless a section of it could be exposed to some sort of impact or cutting damage hazard.

iSpring,B008H71Q4C,ICEK,"After installing the ice maker kit, I have very little pressure from my cold water faucet and water at the fridge is very weak as well.

Please make sure that the distance from the RO to the tank is within 15 feet. Additionally, make sure that the tank pressure is sufficient to perform the task. Make sure that the fridge and icemaker don't have a minimum pressure requirement that exceeds what the pressure tank can provide. EX: Some refrigerators or icemakers need at least 40 psi to work. You can use a gauge at the front air valve to check tank pressure.For additional troubleshooting, please contact our customer service dept. at 678-261-7611 or via email at feedback@ispringfilter.com.Kind Regards,iSpring Water SystemsTel: (678) 261-7611Email: feedback@ispringfilter.com ",0," September 4, 2019",A manufacturer
